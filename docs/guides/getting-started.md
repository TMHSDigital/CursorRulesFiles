This guide will help you get started with using the CursorRules collection in your projects.

## Quick Start

1. Choose the rules you need:
   - For a full-stack project: Copy all rules
   - For frontend only: Copy `frontend` and `core` rules

2. Place the rules:
   - Put core rules in your project root
   - Place specific rules in their respective directories
