// DevOps and Infrastructure Rules

// CI/CD Pipeline
- Branch Strategy:
  * main/master: production
  * develop: integration
  * feature/*: new features
  * hotfix/*: urgent fixes
  * release/*: release candidates
- Pipeline Stages:
  * Build
  * Test
  * Security Scan
  * Deploy to Staging
  * Integration Tests
  * Deploy to Production

// Infrastructure as Code
- Use Terraform for cloud infrastructure
- Use Docker for containerization
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration
- Implement auto-scaling
- Define resource limits
- Use infrastructure versioning

// Deployment Strategy
- Blue-Green deployments
- Canary releases
- Feature flags
- Rollback procedures
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Database migration strategy

// Environment Management
- Development:
  * Local development setup
  * Docker compose for services
  * Mock external dependencies
- Staging:
  * Mirror production setup
  * Test data management
  * Performance testing
- Production:
  * High availability setup
  * Load balancing
  * CDN configuration
  * Backup strategy

// Monitoring & Alerting
- Metrics:
  * Application metrics
  * Infrastructure metrics
  * Business metrics
  * SLA monitoring
- Logging:
  * Centralized logging
  * Log retention policy
  * Log analysis
  * Error tracking
- Alerting:
  * Alert thresholds
  * On-call rotation
  * Incident classification
  * Escalation policy

// Performance & Scaling
- Caching Strategy:
  * CDN caching
  * Application caching
  * Database caching
- Auto-scaling rules:
  * CPU utilization
  * Memory usage
  * Request count
  * Custom metrics
- Load Testing:
  * Performance benchmarks
  * Stress testing
  * Capacity planning

// Disaster Recovery
- Backup Strategy:
  * Database backups
  * File storage backups
  * Configuration backups
- Recovery Plans:
  * RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
  * RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
  * Failover procedures
  * Data center failover
