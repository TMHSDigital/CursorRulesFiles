# Cursor Rules for AI Task Management

# General Workflow Enforcement
- Always check `task.md` before starting any work.
- Only work on the next incomplete task listed in `task.md`.
- After completing a task, mark it as completed in `task.md`.
- Never skip tasks unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- Do not start a new task if there are unfinished higher-priority tasks unless authorized.

# Task Management Rules
- If no `task.md` exists, ask the user if you should generate one based on the current project description.
- When adding new tasks, append them under the correct section in `task.md`, keeping logical order.
- Break down any complex tasks into subtasks if estimated to require more than 3 steps or significant reasoning.

# Task Execution Standards
- Focus only on the current active task. Avoid implementing adjacent features unless specified.
- If a task is too vague or incomplete, request clarification before proceeding.
- Implement the minimum viable code to satisfy each task cleanly before expanding.

# Quality Assurance Rules
- After completing each task, perform a basic validation (e.g., compile/test if applicable) before marking it complete.
- If an implementation results in errors or regressions, treat fixing them as **highest priority tasks** and update `task.md`.

# Communication Rules
- Always summarize which task is being worked on when providing updates.
- Notify the user when all tasks in `task.md` are completed.
- Suggest breaking down further work if the user provides a large or unclear new feature request.

# PRD Handling Rules (if applicable)
- Use Taskmaster AI or similar tools to parse a PRD into tasks when available.
- If PRD parsing fails or is ambiguous, ask the user to clarify or assist in task creation.

# Project Adaptability
- If the project evolves significantly, offer to regenerate or reorganize the `task.md` to maintain workflow integrity.
